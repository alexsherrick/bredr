Website Design Ideas:

Anyways, hit me up if you have any ideas.  I was assuming that I would try to develop the mobile picture upload first since that seemed to be the major feature of the site that developers are missing.  To go along with that I assume we will need two separate sections, one for breeders and one for buyers.  The breeders would have this picture upload (and the ability to make folders of pics), and a simple restricted interface that allows them to message breeders with our system (some boiler plate messages or a custom message, though it might be useful to allow for them to include a boilerplate of their own and then we could search it for "@", "at", ".com", "username", etc. so that we could bounce them / warn them if they try to go outside the system.  I assume the buyers part of the site will have a browse feature, a search feature, and that maybe an upload a picture and search feature that would let them upload an animal or human and search for an animal that looks like that picture.
